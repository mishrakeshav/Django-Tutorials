Django Operates on Models-Templates-Views paradigm 
Steps :-

1) In the views.py file we import any models that we need to use 
2) Use the view to query the model for data that we will need 
3) Pass results from the models to the template
4) Edit the template so that it is ready to accept and display the data from the model	
5) Map a URL to the view
